- I CAN'T STOP THE LONELINESS!
+ I CAN'T HOLD BACK, MY SORROW DOESN'T STOP.

- I CAN'T STOP THE LONELINESS!
+ WHY WON'T THE SADNESS STOP..

YOUR GIRLFRIEND
I STILL REGRET THAT YOU MET HER
YOU TWO FELT SYMPATHY
THAT AFTERNOON ON THE CAFE TERRACE

THAT DAY THE PHONE
IT RANG
IT WAS HER TELLING ME TO BREAK UP WITH YOU

- I CAN'T STOP THE LONELINESS
+ WHY WON'T THE SADNESS STOP..

IT'S A "MISUNDERSTANDING"
YOU SMILED, BUT YOUR KISS..
IT SMELLS LIKE LIES

AND WHILE YOU WERE HUGGING ME, I NOTICED
THAT THERE WAS NO.. LOVE..

LOVE IS SMALL,
LIKE A STORM
BOTH FRIENDS AND LOVERS
SWEPT AWAY!!!!

- I CAN'T STOP THE LONELINESS!
+ GIVE HIM BACK, MY SORROW DOESN'T STOP.

- I CAN'T STOP!
- THE LONELINESS.
+ SOMEONE HELP ME, MY SORROW DOESN'T STOP.

- I CAN'T STOP!
- THE LONELINESS.
+ I CAN'T HOLD BACK, MY SORROW DOESN'T STOP.

- I CAN'T STOP THE LONELINESS!
+ WHY WON'T THE SADNESS STOP..

- I CAN'T STOP!
- THE LONELINESS.
+ WHY WON'T THE SADNESS STOP..

- I CAN'T STOP!.
